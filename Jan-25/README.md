 # Ternary Operators

Ternary operators are a concise way to write conditional expressions.

They consist of three parts: a condition, a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false.

 * @param num1 The first number to compare.
 * @param num2 The second number to compare.
 * @return The larger of the two numbers.

```java
public int getMax(int num1, int num2) {
    int max = (num1 > num2) ? num1 : num2;
    return max;
}
```

# Working with Arrays and Strings

- An array is a data structure used to store elements of the same data type.
- In array elements are accessed directly by using its index number.
- Stores multiple items

### Advantages of ARRAYS

1. Code Optimization (less code)
2. Random Access
3. Easy to traverse data
4. Easy to manipulate data
5. Easy to sory data

## Types of Arrays

There are `TWO` Types of Arrays:
1. Single Dimensional Array
3. Multi Dimensional Array

### Single Dimensional Array
It is also called as One-Dimensional-Array

It has singel set of square bracket `[....]`

Example:
```java
// declare an array
int[] age;

// allocate memory for array
age = new int[5];
```
