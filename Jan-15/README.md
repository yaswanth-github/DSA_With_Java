# Java Variables Overview

In Java, a **variable** is the data container that saves values during Java program execution.

## Instance Variable

Instance variables are stored in the heap area. They are declared in the main class but not within any specific method. These variables can be accessed using an object or object reference.


## Class Variable

Class variables are stored in the method area. They are declared in the class using the static keyword but not within the main method. Class variables can be accessed directly, using the class name, or through an object or object reference.

## Local Variable

Local variables are stored in the stack area. They are declared within a specific method, such as the main method, and can be accessed directly within that method.
